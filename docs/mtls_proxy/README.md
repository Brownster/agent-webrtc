# mTLS Proxy Server

This directory contains a simple example proxy that can be used to add optional mTLS support for customers. The proxy forwards requests from the extension to a customer's Pushgateway using mutual TLS.

## Overview

1. The browser extension can be configured to send metrics either directly to a Pushgateway or through this proxy.
2. When using the proxy, the extension authenticates with an API key. The proxy then forwards the request to the appropriate Pushgateway using mTLS client certificates.

## Files

- `proxy-server.js` – Example Node.js/Express proxy server implementing mTLS forwarding.
- `onboard_customer.sh` – Utility script to generate certificates and API keys for new customers and update the proxy configuration.

## Usage

1. Copy the files in this directory to your server that will host the proxy.
2. Follow the instructions in `onboard_customer.sh` to set up a Certificate Authority (CA) and onboard customers.
3. Deploy the proxy and use the API keys generated by the script within the browser extension settings when mTLS is required.

This example is provided as a reference implementation. Adapt it to fit your own infrastructure and security requirements.
