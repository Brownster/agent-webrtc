A WebRTC Detective Story: How We Tamed a Complex Third-Party Web App

In the world of software development, there's a problem more common and frustrating than almost any other: "It works on platforms A and B, but fails on platform C." This was the exact situation we faced with our enterprise-grade Chrome extension, the "WebRTC Stats Exporter Pro." Our tool, designed to capture and export critical call quality metrics, worked flawlessly on Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. But on Genesys Cloud, our primary target, it was blind. It reported zero active connections, even when a call was clearly in progress.

This is the story of our investigation—a journey that took us from the usual suspects to the deep, architectural underpinnings of modern web applications. It wasn't one bug, but a series of architectural hurdles we had to overcome to achieve true reliability.
Phase 1: The Initial Investigation & The Usual Suspects

Every debugging session starts with the most likely culprits. For Chrome extensions interacting with complex web pages, the two prime suspects are always iframes and Content Security Policies (CSP).

Suspect #1: The Iframe Hideout

Many complex applications, especially contact center platforms, don't run as a single page. They often place key components, like a softphone, inside an <iframe>. An iframe is essentially a webpage embedded within another webpage, and crucially, it has its own separate window object.

Our initial hypothesis was simple: our script was running in the main Genesys page, but the RTCPeerConnection was being created inside a hidden softphone iframe. Our code was in the right house, but the wrong room.

We hunted for this iframe by inspecting the DOM and using the context selector in the Chrome DevTools console. But after a thorough search, we came up empty. The softphone was being rendered directly into the main page's DOM. Hypothesis 1 was a dead end.

Suspect #2: The Content Security Policy (CSP) Blockade

Our second suspect was the page's CSP. A CSP is a set of security rules a web server sends to the browser, dictating what resources (scripts, images, network requests) the page is allowed to load. We theorized that perhaps our extension's attempt to send data to our Prometheus Pushgateway was being blocked by a strict connect-src policy from Genesys's servers.

This turned out to be a real issue, but we discovered it was a symptom of a later problem, not the root cause of our blindness.
Phase 2: The Breakthrough - Catching the Call in the Act

Since the softphone wasn't in an iframe, the WebRTC code had to be running in the main page's context. Our first attempt to see it was a simple "monkey-patch" of the browser's RTCPeerConnection function:

      
// The simple (and failing) approach
window.OriginalRTCPeerConnection = window.RTCPeerConnection;
window.RTCPeerConnection = MyCustomProxy;

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This failed. We were still blind. This led to our first major breakthrough: the Genesys SDK was likely caching a reference to the original RTCPeerConnection function during its initialization, long before our extension's script had a chance to replace it.

To beat this, we needed a more powerful interception technique: Object.defineProperty.

Instead of simply replacing the function, we redefined the RTCPeerConnection property on the window object itself.

      
// override.js - The "Master Interceptor"
const OriginalRTCPeerConnection = window.RTCPeerConnection;

const RTCPeerConnectionProxy = function(...args) {
    console.log('!!!!!! INTERCEPTED: new RTCPeerConnection() CALLED !!!!!!');
    const pc = new OriginalRTCPeerConnection(...args);
    webrtcInternalsExporter.add(pc); // Add to our tracker
    return pc;
};

Object.defineProperty(window, 'RTCPeerConnection', {
    get: function() {
        console.log('[Override] A script is GETTING RTCPeerConnection. Returning our proxy.');
        return RTCPeerConnectionProxy;
    },
    set: function(newValue) {
        console.warn('[Override] A script is trying to overwrite our interceptor!');
        // In the first version, we simply ignored this.
    }
});

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. JavaScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This worked! By defining a get function, we ensured that no matter when the Genesys code asked for RTCPeerConnection, it was our get function that answered the call and served up our proxy. We were finally intercepting the connection.
Phase 3: The Plot Twist - A Warning Reveals an Ally

Our success was quickly followed by a new, alarming message in the console:

    [webrtc-internal-exporter:override] A script is trying to SET window.RTCPeerConnection. We are ignoring it.

Initially, this looked like another problem—the Genesys app was fighting back! But the stack trace revealed the true culprit: webrtc-adapter. This is a friendly, open-source library used by almost everyone to normalize browser differences. It wasn't being hostile; it was just trying to do its job by applying its own standardized wrapper.

Our set function was correctly defending our override, but a better approach is to cooperate. We refined the set function to allow the adapter to apply its shim, and then we simply re-wrapped their shim with our own proxy. This gave us maximum compatibility and interception power.
Phase 4: The Final Challenge & The Self-Destructing Messenger

We could now see the calls from start to finish. Yet, a new problem emerged. While it worked on Teams and Meet, on Genesys Cloud the call would end, and we'd get a new error:

    Error sending stats to background: Extension context invalidated.

This was the final, critical clue. This error only occurs when a script tries to communicate with a part of the extension that has been destroyed.

We realized the core architectural difference between the platforms:

    Teams/Meet: When a call ends, they perform a "gentle" UI update, hiding elements on the same page. Our content script stays alive.

    Genesys Cloud: When a call ends, it performs an "aggressive" Single-Page Application (SPA) navigation. To the browser, the URL has effectively changed, so it instantly terminates our content script to clean up resources.

This created a race condition. Our override script would capture the final "closed" stats and try to pass them to the content script for relay to the background, but the content script was already gone.

To solve this, we needed a more resilient communication channel than the simple, one-off chrome.runtime.sendMessage. We re-architected our communication layer to use long-lived connections via chrome.runtime.connect.

This is the architectural equivalent of switching from sending a text message (sendMessage) to making a phone call (connect). A port is established between the content script and the background script, creating a persistent "phone line." Now, messages can be sent reliably. Most importantly, if the Genesys page navigates and "hangs up" on the content script, the onDisconnect event instantly notifies the background script. This allows our lifecycle-manager.js to perform a graceful cleanup, preventing memory leaks and ensuring the extension remains stable.
Conclusion: Key Lessons for Enterprise-Grade Extensions

Our journey to tame the Genesys Cloud application taught us several invaluable lessons for building robust browser extensions:

    Anticipate Hostile Environments: Assume third-party apps will have complex, insulated architectures. Start with the most powerful interception techniques, like Object.defineProperty.

    Understand the Lifecycle: Be aware that SPAs can have aggressive navigation and cleanup cycles that can invalidate your content scripts at any moment.

    Use the Right Communication Tool: For any data that needs to be reliably transmitted from a content script, especially during teardown events, a persistent port (chrome.runtime.connect) is vastly superior to a fire-and-forget message (chrome.runtime.sendMessage).

    Embrace Defensive Programming: Features like circuit breakers and robust messaging aren't just for servers; they are critical for client-side applications that must operate in an environment they do not control.

By following this investigative process and building a progressively more resilient architecture, we successfully evolved our tool from one that merely worked on simple platforms to an enterprise-ready solution capable of handling the most complex and dynamic web applications.
